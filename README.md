# About
It is a web-app made to help those who are currently working remotely by helping them plan their schedule and reminding them of leftover tasks which would eventually help them to work more efficiently.It would also act as a productivity tool to those people since they do not have someone to remind them of the tasks that they were supposed to do earlier.We have created a user-based system in which once you create an account , you will get access to a dashboard where in you can add tasks, delete tasks, update tasks. One of the key feautres is that we have set up a cron job on a particular view method which would send emails to the users every hour of the day regarding the tasks that are not yet marked complete by them hence helping them be more productive.
